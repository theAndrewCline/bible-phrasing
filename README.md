# Bible Phrasing App

The Bible Phrasing App is meant to enable communities to read and study the bible together, either in person or online.

The Goal of this project is to create an interactive editor that that will open a selected passage and allow the user to highlight, annotate, rearange the target passage. The user should also be able to share the results quickly and easily, if the editting session is live, emailing ideas to a friend, or sharing it on our community discord chanel.
